      <description>Surf Forecasts and a History of Hacking I&amp;rsquo;ve been fiddling around with a prominent surf forecast website for awhile now (especially around their API).

Just to note, I do pay for premium and would recommend it to any surfers out there (not that this is an ad for the site or anything).</description>

The task seemed fairly straightforward:
 Rename a database column called mastery to track_mentor. A Add a route (kind of like a controller and a route in Rails but&amp;hellip; Sinatra).</description>
